# PhotoVoltaic-Inverter-using-MATLAB-
The project  involves the simulation and analysis of a 50KW grid tied photovoltaic inverter system using MATLAB/ simulink . the model is designed to convert DC power generated from a photovoltaic (PV) source into AC power that can be synchronized and fed into the utility grid .
